# -Hospital_Management_System
 This project is a simple hospital management system that uses basic data structures to manage patients, doctors, and appointments effectively. We used a linked list for patient records, a binary search tree for doctor records, a circular queue for appointment requests, and a stack to undo the last scheduling action. The system is menu-driven, which makes it easy to add, delete, search, and process data quickly
